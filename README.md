# Milne Method for Solving Second-Order Differential Equations

This repository presents a study on the Milne method for solving second-order differential equations, incorporating the Runge-Kutta 4th order "3/8" method for initial value estimation.

The repository includes MATLAB scripts implementing the Milne method alongside the RK4 "3/8" method for initial value computations with various 
test cases. These are provided to demonstrate the application of the Milne method to different second-order differential equations.
